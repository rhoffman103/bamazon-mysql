## mySQL node.js app

This app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## Requirments
The app should then prompt users with two messages.

- ask the ID of the product the customer would like to buy.
-ask how many units to purchase.

Once order is placed, app will check if the store has sufficient inventory

If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.


However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.

Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
